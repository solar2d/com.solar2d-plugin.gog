Summary:
The files under this directory contains a subset of the files included in Corona Enterprise build #2872.
It only includes the header files and libraries needed to build the plugin.

We do not use a symlink to Corona Enterprise for OS X builds like other plugins.
This is to ensure that the OS X and Win32 plugins are both built with the same Corona version.
